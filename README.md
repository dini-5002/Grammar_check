# Grammar Autocorrect
## Introduction 
This project aims to provide automatic grammar correction for text inputs.
We have tried to seperate all the grammatical problems and solve them individually.

## Tasks:
  - Spelling check
  - Punctuation correction 
  - Basic grammatical errors - Tense errors, Subject Verb agreement, prepositions, articles etc.
  - Tone Suggestions
  - Suggesting better vocabulary

### Things done till now:
   - [Spellcheck](https://github.com/dini-5002/Grammar_check/blob/main/Spellcheck.ipynb) :
   We have used functions such as edit and probability to give the most probable corrected form of the incorrect word identified.
   - [Puntuation](https://github.com/dini-5002/Grammar_check/blob/main/Punctuation.ipynb) :
   We have used a rule based approch to correct basic punctuation errors in a text.
   - [Subject - Verb](https://github.com/dini-5002/Grammar_check/blob/main/subverb.ipynb) :
   Here we have tried to use some basic neural network methods to check whether a sentence has subject verb agreement error or not. This is still in progress.

### Things to be added:
   - Correct basic grammatical errors: For this we are planning to use neural network such as RNN.
   - Tone suggestion: We are thinking of doing this with contextual analysis using neural networks.
   - Improving vocabulary: We are planning to do this with taking help of a dictionary to provide alternative for overused words.
