## Features
- Grammar Correction: Automatically detects and corrects grammatical errors, including spelling and punctuation issues, using fine-tuned transformer models.
- Tone Analysis: Analyzes the tone of the text and provides a bar graph visualization to represent emotional sentiment, uses a pretrained model.
- Vocabulary Enhancement: Enhances the vocabulary of a given text by replacing common words with their contextual synonyms. 

## Interface

### How the Interface Works
